# Theory vs. Practice

- List 3 reasons why asymptotic analysis may be misleading with respect to
  actual performance in practice.

- Suppose finding a particular element in a binary search tree with 1,000
  elements takes 5 seconds. Given what you know about the asymptotic complexity
  of search in a binary search tree, how long would you guess finding the same
  element in a search tree with 10,000 elements takes? Explain your reasoning.

- You measure the time with 10,000 elements and it takes 100 seconds! List 3
  reasons why this could be the case, given that reasoning with the asymptotic
  complexity suggests a different time.

Response: Not Complete

The first issue with asymptotic analysis being potentially misleading is due to a fundamental characteristic of asymptotic analysis as a whole.
Asymptotic analysis focuses upon the highest order and most important term in regards to performance. 
However, smaller order terms still make an impact. In varying situations, these smaller order terms still can make a difference to the overall performance and runtime,
though with asymptotic analysis, they are however ignored at large.
